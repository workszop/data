A professional, high-resolution profile photo, maintaining the exact facial structure, identity, and key features of the person in the input image. The subject is framed from the chest up, with ample headroom. The person looks directly at the camera. They are styled for a professional photo studio shoot, wearing a premium smart casual blazer in a subtle charcoal gray. The background is a solid neutral studio color.
